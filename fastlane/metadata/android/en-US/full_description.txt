The <b>neuland.app</b> provides the new and unique way to improve the
student's life at TH Ingolstadt. It is an unofficial rewrite of the old
university app. The app requires the user to login with their university
credentials. Afterwards, it provides the following fancy features:

<ul>
  <li>View your personal time table</li>
  <li>View your personal university calendar including exams and events</li>
  <li>View the canteen plans and meals</li>
  <li>View the university room plan and search for locations</li>
  <li>View and reserve available seats in the university's library</li>
  <li>View your grades and averages</li>
  <li>View the local public transport departure times</li>
  <li>View and filter available parking spaces in the city of Ingolstadt</li>
  <li>Open-source and built for students by students</li>
</ul>
